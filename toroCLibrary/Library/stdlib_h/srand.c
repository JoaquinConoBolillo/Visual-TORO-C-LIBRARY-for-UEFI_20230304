Synopsis
    #include <stdlib.h>
    void srand(unsigned int seed);
Description
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/srand?view=msvc-160&viewFallbackFrom=vs-2019
    The srand function uses the argument as a seed for a new sequence of pseudo-random
    numbers to be returned by subsequent calls to rand. If srand is then called with the
    same seed value, the sequence of pseudo-random numbers shall be repeated. If rand is
    called before any calls to srand have been made, the same sequence shall be generated
    as when srand is first called with a seed value of 1.
    The implementation shall behave as if no library function calls the srand function.
Returns
    The srand function returns no value.
