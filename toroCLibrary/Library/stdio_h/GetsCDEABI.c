Synopsis
    #include <stdio.h>
    char *gets(char *s);
Description
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/gets-getws?view=msvc-160&viewFallbackFrom=vs-2019
    The gets function reads characters from the input stream pointed to by
    stdin, into the array pointed to by s, until  end-of-file  is  encountered
    or a new-line character is read. Any new-line character is discarded, and
    a null character is written immediately after the last character read into the array.
Returns
    The gets function returns s if successful. If end-of-file is encountered and no
    characters have been read into the array, the contents of the array remain unchanged and a
    null pointer is returned.  If a read error occurs during the operation, the array contents are
    indeterminate and a null pointer is returned.
