Synopsis

    #include <stdio.h
    size_t fwrite(const void* ptr, size_t size, size_t nelem, FILE* stream);
Description
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/fwrite?view=msvc-160&viewFallbackFrom=vs-2019
    The fwrite function writes, from the array pointed to by ptr, up to nmemb elements
    whose size is specified by size, to the stream pointed to by stream. For each object,
    size calls are made to the fputc function, taking the values (in order) from an array of
    unsigned char exactly overlaying the object. The file position indicator for the
    stream (if defined) is advanced by the number of characters successfully written. If an
    error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator for the stream is
    indeterminate.
Paramters

Returns
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/fwrite?view=msvc-160#return-value
    The fwrite function returns the number of elements successfully written, which will be
    less than nmemb only if a write error is encountered. If size or nmemb is zero,
    fwrite returns zero and the state of the stream remains unchanged
